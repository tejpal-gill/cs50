            <p class="book">My CS50 adventure started with a YouTube video back in 2021,
                when I was still in high school. At the time, I attended the first lecture,
                but the schoolwork kept me from diving deeper and submitting the assignment. <br><br>
                Once I graduated in 2023, I decided to take CS50x more seriously and tried sticking to the weekly schedule.
                Things kicked off with Scratch, and I was having a blast. <br><br>
                Then came the Tideman problem, and it shook my schedule I was pretty lost,
                the Duck Debugger wasn't released yet so I turned to the
                CS50 Discord community for help, still it took me a whole five days to figure it out! <br><br>
                Since overcoming that challenge, it's been relatively smooth sailing, with just a few bumps along the way.
                Right now, I'm on in this problem set, and I'm loving every minute of it. </p>
