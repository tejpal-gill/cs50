Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

It went as expected.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would prefer to use 10,000 simulations in that scenario since it provides sufficient stability while still remaning on the lower end of the computation time spectrum.
